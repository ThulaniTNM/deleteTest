# Future

Being at this age, 28 years does have its disadvantages when you have to think of the future.
All this time i have wasted could have,should have been put to good use.
I'm at a point whereby i have to get my finances in order, my love for learning is challenged by what i have achieved and not have achieved in life.
I personally believe that once a person gets a stable job that somehow takes a lot of weight of your shoulders and that's the current predicament that i find myself in.
I'm honest with myself,sometimes i try to see things not from a believe that i will fail but from the possibility that perhaps things might not work out as i want them too.
I'm old enough to know that failure exists.
I have given myself two more years to pursue coding, to be involved in any learning organization,to complete my certificate with freecodecamp and to build my profile.
This two years also involves the possibility of me being part of Umuzi,
i'm also highly interested in the work experience that comes with it after most of the theoretical and practical learning.
I think two years is enough for me to actually scale if i have to continue with this career or not.
I have dreams that do require a tech savvy mind. I have an idea that requires me to utilize this skill i'm chasing.
This idea however is still possibible to achieve without me really pulling the technicals strings but just having a group of skilled individual that will see my vision and
digitize it,the only downfall of that is that i get to be less technical involved,that takes away the fun that comes with problem solving.
Realistically my timeline of achieving is short,i may be putting a lot of pressure on myself but that is the price we pay for coming from less fortunate families.
I would really want to be leaving the life of a freelancer,not really bounded by a 9-5 but that's something i'm aiming for as soon as i get proper experience in the coding field.
Should everything workout in the next two years this would actually allow me to stretch my timeline and add at least 10 years of working and learning the ins and out of technology.
I think when things start to pick up this will also mean having new goals,ideas and a shift in mindset,character development and less burden.
Sometimes rushing to succeed also has a negative impact on me ,
i'm able to recognize that maybe i'm rushing my plans and i need to go back to the drawing board but for now i'm strictly on a two year course to try and 
build something for myself.
I'm not aiming for anything really complex, i have decided that frontend development will be my main focus,with backend dev being something that i have to occasionally entertain.
My problem that i'm trying to solve is not a really complex one but it is one thing that people face everyday and my solution to it is so simple and effective thaat it actually solves a problem people didn't even realize that they have .
It involves automation and human interact so its suitable for what 4IR is trying to incorporate in our everyday lives.
